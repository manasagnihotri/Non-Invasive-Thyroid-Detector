# Non-Invasive-Thyroid-Detector
Thyroid detection using machine learning is a comprehensive solution for detecting thyroid disease.
The project includes a pipeline that preprocesses the medical reports, extracts relevant features, trains a machine learning model, and deploys the model for inference. The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of medical reports of thyroid nodules obtained from UCI repository page.
The machine learning model used for the detection of thyroid abnormalities is  logistic regression, decision tree,random forest and XGBoost.In model selection, we select the Random forest and XGBoost as their accuracy is maximum than others.
The project is designed to be easily adaptable and extendable, allowing for future enhancements and improvements. It is also documented with detailed instructions and explanations, making it easy for other researchers and developers to use and build upon the project.
